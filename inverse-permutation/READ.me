# Inverse Permutation

This catalog contains my solution to an assignment in the Operating Systems course.
The task was to write a function in Assembly which given an array of integers, checks whether it describes a permutation and if so, inverts it.

`inverse_permutations.asm` file contains my solution.
`inverse_permutations_example.c` file is for basic testing - macros and some tests were given, I've added some tests.
