This repository contains my solution to an assignment in the Individual Programming Project class.

The assignment: find the solution to a multi-dimensional labyrinth. 

Input:
First line contains the dimensions of the labyrinth.
Second line contains the entrance coordinates.
Third line contains the exit coordinates.
Fourth line contains the wall positions encoded in one of two ways.

Output:
ERROR L - if line L contains invalid input.
NO WAY - if there is no path from the entrance to the exit.
N - if the input is valid and there is a path, the number of steps in the shortest path from the entrance to the exit.

Solution written in C - implements BFS, vector, FIFO queue, bitmap.
